<body>
    <h1>Dataset Overview</h1>
    <p>
        The dataset accompanying the Science Knowledge Survey encompasses a comprehensive collection of responses from individuals of varying demographic backgrounds. Designed to evaluate the general science literacy among the population, the survey covers topics ranging from basic biology to advanced principles of physics and environmental science.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p>
        Participants were asked to complete an online questionnaire, consisting of multiple-choice questions, demographic inquiries, and optional open-ended questions for additional insights. The demographic information collected includes age, education level, gender, and geographical location, ensuring a diverse and representative sample of the population.

    <h2>Dataset Structure</h2>
    <p>
        The dataset is structured into several columns, each representing a different aspect of the collected information:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Research ID:</strong> A unique identifier for each participant.</li>
        <li><strong>Age:</strong> The age of the participant.</li>
        <li><strong>Education Level:</strong> The highest level of education completed by the participant.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Usage</h2>
    <p>
        This dataset is intended for use by researchers, educators, and policymakers to assess the state of science knowledge and understanding among the general public. Analysis of the data can help identify areas where science education may need to be bolstered or adjusted to better serve the population's needs.
